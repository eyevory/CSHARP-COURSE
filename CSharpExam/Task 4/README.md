## Task 4 code issues
The code wants to do calculations based on user input by calling methods that do the calculation and return the result value. The methods are coded to return strings, and take string input without converting to a variable you can do calculations with. 
## Task 4 code fixes
By changing the methods to return a double or integer, and converting the input either in the method or in the main class, we can get the desired outcome. The return values are also changed to remove unnecessary characters.

The main code was also wrapped in Try-Catch to deal with invalid input so the program does not crash.
